    <p><strong>A New Beginning</strong><br>
    I remember my first day learning English at ISTS very clearly. I felt nervous but also
    excited because everything was new for me. I didn’t know many people, and I was
    worried about speaking English in class. The teacher started speaking in English, and I
    tried to understand as much as I could.
    <br><br>
    During that class, I learned basic greetings and simple expressions. I made some
    mistakes, but the teacher helped me a lot. I realized that learning English was not
    going to be easy, but it was possible. That first day motivated me to continue studying
    and improving my English skills.</p>

    <p><strong>My First Challenge</strong><br>
    My first English test was a big challenge for me. I studied vocabulary and grammar at
    home, but I was still nervous. When the teacher gave us the test, I felt pressure and
    fear. I didn’t want to fail.
    <br><br>
    While I was answering the questions, I tried to stay calm and focused. Some questions
    were difficult, but others were easier. When I finished the test, I felt relieved. When I
    saw my results later, I felt proud of myself because I passed.</p>

    <p><strong>That Was Embarrassing!</strong><br>
    One day in class, I tried to say something in English, but I used the wrong word.
    Everyone laughed, and I laughed too. At first, I felt embarrassed because I didn’t mean
    to say that. My pronunciation was not very good that day.
    <br><br>
    The teacher explained my mistake in a friendly way. I learned the correct word and how
    to pronounce it better. After that moment, I stopped being afraid of making mistakes.
    That experience helped me feel more confident when speaking English.</p>

    <p><strong>Halloween Team Spirit</strong><br>
    During Halloween, we worked as a team for a special English activity. I felt excited
    because the activity was different and fun. We shared ideas and helped each other.
    Everyone wanted to do a good job.
    <br><br>
    While we were preparing the activity, I practiced my English and learned new
    vocabulary related to Halloween. I felt more confident speaking English. That
    teamwork experience helped me enjoy learning English more.</p>

    <p><strong>Lights, Camera… Halloween!</strong><br>
    For Halloween, we had to record a video in English about something scary. The goal
    was to participate in a competition and win a prize. At first, I felt nervous because
    speaking English in a video was challenging for me.
    <br><br>
    I practiced my lines and recorded the video with confidence. I did my best and tried to
    speak clearly. When the results were announced, I felt very proud because I succeeded.
    That experience motivated me to keep improving my English.</p>

    <p><strong>Still on the Road</strong><br>
    I was still studying English, and I had not finished my learning journey yet. Sometimes
    it felt difficult, but I continued practicing and learning every day. I noticed that my
    vocabulary and understanding improved over time, and that motivated me to keep
    going.
    <br><br>
    Learning English at ISTS and CIS helped me grow personally and academically. I had
    goals and aspirations to continue improving my English skills. This journey taught me
    that progress took time, effort, and motivation, and I felt proud of my learning process.</p>
