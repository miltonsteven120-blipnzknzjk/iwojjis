`A New Beginning
I remember my first day learning English at ISTS very clearly. I felt nervous but also
excited because everything was new for me. I didn’t know many people, and I was
worried about speaking English in class. The teacher started speaking in English, and I
tried to understand as much as I could.
During that class, I learned basic greetings and simple expressions. I made some
mistakes, but the teacher helped me a lot. I realized that learning English was not going
to be easy, but it was possible. That first day motivated me to continue studying and
improving my English skills.`,

`My First Challenge
My first English test was a big challenge for me. I studied vocabulary and grammar at
home, but I was still nervous. When the teacher gave us the test, I felt pressure and fear.
I didn’t want to fail.
While I was answering the questions, I tried to stay calm and focused. Some questions
were difficult, but others were easier. When I finished the test, I felt relieved. When I
saw my results later, I felt proud of myself because I passed.`,

`That Was Embarrassing!
One day in class, I tried to say something in English, but I used the wrong word.
Everyone laughed, and I laughed too. At first, I felt embarrassed because I didn’t mean
to say that. My pronunciation was not very good that day.
The teacher explained my mistake in a friendly way. I learned the correct word and how
to pronounce it better. After that moment, I stopped being afraid of making mistakes.
That experience helped me feel more confident when speaking English.`,

`Halloween Team Spirit
During Halloween, we worked as a team for a special English activity. I felt excited
because the activity was different and fun. We shared ideas and helped each other.
Everyone wanted to do a good job.
While we were preparing the activity, I practiced my English and learned new
vocabulary related to Halloween. I felt more confident speaking English. That
teamwork experience helped me enjoy learning English more.`,

`Lights, Camera… Halloween!
For Halloween, we had to record a video in English about something scary. The goal
was to participate in a competition and win a prize. At first, I felt nervous because
speaking English in a video was challenging for me.
I practiced my lines and recorded the video with confidence. I did my best and tried to
speak clearly. When the results were announced, I felt very proud because I succeeded.
That experience motivated me to keep improving my English.`,

`Still on the Road
I was still studying English, and I had not finished my learning journey yet. Sometimes
it felt difficult, but I continued practicing and learning every day. I noticed that my
vocabulary and understanding improved over time, and that motivated me to keep
going.
Learning English at ISTS and CIS helped me grow personally and academically. I had
goals and aspirations to continue improving my English skills. This journey taught me
that progress took time, effort, and motivation, and I felt proud of my learning process.`
